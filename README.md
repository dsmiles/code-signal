## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my solutions to coding challenges from CodeSignal/CodaPad. I will need to organise the solutions into various topics, but for now they're all in the main package.

## Solutions

Feel free to look at the test classes for my solutions to the various tasks.  Where I feel I could do better, I've refactored the code. I need to add more comments to the code in order to explain the original tasks. 

**Note:**
My solution to the `AdjacentElementsProductTest` needs further work as it doesn't currently handle larger arrays correctly.

## How to Use

To run any of the solutions, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dsmiles/code-siginal
    cd code-signal
    ```
2. Run the Maven tests:
    ```
    mvn clean test
    ```
